# MAL-Crawler for data-gathering
A Project for educational purposes

## Usage

This application can scan and save Anime-Data from [MAL](https://myanimelist.net/) in a primitive way to a DB.

## Purpose and what I learned

I gained a lot of experience in **python** itself, as well as the **selenium** automation-tool. It was fun and challenging to build a data-extractor. 
At one point, using my schools server-power, I accidentally DDOSd [MAL](https://myanimelist.net/). I'd like to apologize for that. ðŸ˜…<br/><br/>
It was an experience worthwhile and I look forward to working more with these tools.
